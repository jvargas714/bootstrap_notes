Quick Notes on some tags
<!doctype>
    - declaration must be the very first thing in the html
    - only one way to do this in html5 and its like this
<meta>
    - always goes inside the <head> element
    - always passed as name value pairs
    - should always include the viewport attribute
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        Meta elements are typically used to specify page description, keywords,
            author of the document, last modified, and other metadata.
    - note that keywords can be used by search engines to find pages better
    <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30">
        * this will refresh the page every 30 secs
    - the http-equiv provides an HTTP header for the information/value of the content attribute
    - content provides the actual value of the attribute that is specified

<hr>
    - provides a thematic break in an HTML page, looks like a line
